# Mont Blanc Reservation Page Monitor

This Python script monitors the Mont Blanc reservation pages and sends an email notification whenever any of the pages change.

---

## Features

* Monitors multiple URLs simultaneously.
* Detects any change in the full page content.
* Sends email notifications to multiple recipients.
* Configurable check interval.
* Easy setup using a `.env` file.
* Can be tested locally using a local HTML file.

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Packages: `requests`, `python-dotenv`

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository or download the script

### 2. Create a `.env` file

Create a file named `.env` in the project folder with the following content:

```env
EMAIL_ADDRESS=yourgmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
RECIPIENTS=friend1@gmail.com,friend2@gmail.com
```

* `EMAIL_ADDRESS` → your Gmail address.
* `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` → Gmail App Password (see instructions below).
* `SMTP_SERVER` → usually `smtp.gmail.com` for Gmail.
* `SMTP_PORT` → usually `587` for Gmail.
* `RECIPIENTS` → comma-separated list of emails to notify.

---

### 3. Generate a Gmail App Password

1. Enable 2-Step Verification in your Google account.
2. Go to **Security > App passwords**.
3. Create a new App password for **Mail** and your device (e.g., name it `MontBlancNotifier`).
4. Copy the password and use it as `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file.

---

### 4. Configure URLs and check interval

In `monitor_montblanc.py`, edit the following:

```python
URLS = [
    "https://montblanc.ffcam.fr/index.php?&_lang=GB&&_lang=GB",
    "https://montblanc.ffcam.fr/GB_home.html"
]
CHECK_INTERVAL = 300  # seconds (default 5 minutes)
```

* Add or remove URLs as needed.
* Adjust `CHECK_INTERVAL` for how often you want the script to check the pages.

---

### 5. Run the script

From the terminal, run:

```bash
python monitor_montblanc.py
```

* On first run, the script captures the initial state of all pages.
* It will check the pages every `CHECK_INTERVAL` seconds.
* If any page changes, an email will be sent listing the changed pages.

---

## Testing the script

To safely test without waiting for the Mont Blanc pages to change:

1. Create a local HTML file, e.g., `MontBlanc.html`.
2. Start a local HTTP server in the folder containing the file:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

3. Change the URL in `URLS` to:

```python
URLS = ["http://localhost:8000/MontBlanc.html"]
```

4. Run the script. Edit the HTML file to trigger a change and check that an email is received.

---

## Notes

* The script only sends one email per detected change.
* For real Mont Blanc monitoring, a 5-minute interval is recommended.
* Ensure `.env` is **never shared publicly**.
* You can safely revoke your Gmail App Password anytime.

---

## Optional Improvements

* Persist the last page state to disk to survive script restarts.
* Add a log file to track changes over time.
* Integrate Telegram notifications as an alternative to email.
* Customize detection logic for specific keywords if desired.
